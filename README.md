Development Comparison
The project explores C, C++, and Python for game development:

C: Offers efficient, low-level system control, ideal for core gameplay mechanics.
C++: Introduces OOP for improved structure and scalability.
Python: Prioritizes readability and ease of development, especially for rapid iteration and complex logic.
